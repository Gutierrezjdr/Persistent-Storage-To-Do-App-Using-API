     <br> My name is Jessica and I am a <a href ="https://xkcd.com/138/"> Computer Science </a> student at Hunter college. 
    <br>Because I work and go to school at the same time,
     the following is a list of things I used to enjoy doing when I had free time. 
    
   </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Playing <a href= "https://www.xkcd.com/654/"> online video games </a> with my mic on silent. </li>
       <li>Watching movies/show that are <a href = "https://www.xkcd.com/1264/">animated</a>. </li>
       <li>Watching films and movies in movie theaters with <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/991/">questionable hygiene.</a> </li>
       <li>Thinking about grabbing another <a href="https://xkcd.com/1743/">cup of coffee </a> while sipping on a cup of coffee. </li>
    </ul>
